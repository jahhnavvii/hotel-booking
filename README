Hotel Booking Analytics Dashboard

1. Problem Statement

Hotels generate large volumes of booking data from multiple sources such as reservation systems, online travel agencies, and manual entries. This raw data often contains:

* Inconsistent formats (dates, text casing)
* Invalid or missing values (emails, dates)
* Negative or incorrect monetary values
* Unstandardized booking statuses

Because of these data quality issues, it becomes difficult for business stakeholders to:

* Track revenue accurately
* Understand booking trends over time
* Analyze customer behavior and room performance
* Make data-driven decisions

The challenge is to **transform raw hotel booking data into a clean, reliable, and analytics-ready dataset** and present meaningful insights through a dashboard.

2. Why This Project?

This project was built to:

* Simulate a **real-world data engineering pipeline**
* Apply **Bronze–Silver–Gold architecture** in Snowflake
* Perform data validation, cleansing, and transformation
* Enable **business intelligence and KPI tracking** through a dashboard

It demonstrates how raw data can be converted into trusted insights using structured data layers.

3. Architecture Overview

The solution follows a **3-layer data warehouse design**:

🥉 Bronze Layer – Raw Data

* Stores raw hotel booking data exactly as received
* All columns are stored as STRING
* Acts as a historical and auditable data source

🥈 Silver Layer – Cleaned & Validated Data

* Data is cleaned, standardized, and validated
* Correct data types are applied (DATE, INT, FLOAT)
* Business rules are enforced
* Only valid records are promoted

🥇 Gold Layer – Analytics & Reporting

* Aggregated and business-ready tables
* Optimized for dashboards and reporting
* Provides KPIs and trend analysis

4. Data Processing Logic

Bronze → Silver Transformations

The following rules were applied while moving data to the Silver layer:

* **Text Standardization**: Trimmed spaces and applied proper casing
* **Email Validation**: Kept only valid email formats, others set to NULL
* **Date Validation**: Removed records with invalid or illogical dates
* **Revenue Correction**: Converted negative amounts to positive using ABS()
* **Booking Status Normalization**: Standardized inconsistent status values

Only records passing all validations are inserted into the Silver table.

5. Gold Layer Tables

1. `GOLD_BOOKING_CLEAN`

* Fully cleaned, row-level booking data
* Used as the main fact table for analysis

2. `GOLD_AGG_DAILY_BOOKING`

* Aggregated daily bookings and revenue
* Supports time-series analysis

3. `GOLD_AGG_HOTEL_CITY_SALES`

* Aggregated revenue by hotel city
* Helps identify top-performing locations

---

6. Dashboard Overview

The dashboard provides a **high-level and detailed view of hotel performance**.

Key Metrics (KPIs)

* **Total Revenue**: Overall revenue generated
* **Total Bookings**: Number of completed bookings
* **Total Guests**: Total guests served
* **Average Booking Value**: Revenue per booking

Visual Insights

* **Bookings Over Time**: Trend of bookings and revenue
* **Top Cities by Revenue**: Identifies high-revenue locations
* **Room Type Distribution**: Demand across room categories
* **Booking Status Breakdown**: Confirmed vs other statuses

These visuals help stakeholders quickly understand performance and trends.

## 7. How This Dashboard Solves the Problem

* Converts messy raw data into **trusted analytics-ready data**
* Enables quick decision-making using clear KPIs
* Helps hotels identify:

  * Revenue growth or decline
  * Popular room types
  * High-performing cities
  * Seasonal booking patterns

The dashboard bridges the gap between **raw operational data and business intelligence**.
